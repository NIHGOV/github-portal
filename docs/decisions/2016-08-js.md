# Decision: JavaScript

This portal is implemented in JavaScript / Node.

The original Microsoft Open Source Programs Office shipped a .NET (C#) internal product,
the Open Source Hub. While the tool was useful inside the company, it was considered a
non-starter for collaborating with other companies that have OSPO's: at the time, building
on .NET was often considered too specialized, and felt like a typical Microsoft approach.

At the same time, the Azure organization at Microsoft had a Node.js-based similar product,
called the Azure Open Source Portal, created as a hack by @jeffwilcox. The decision was made
to re-platform on top of the Azure portal, migrate data from the Open Source Hub, and use the
JavaScript-based Node app going forward.

Decision made: Calendar 2016, start of FY17
Decision makers: Microsoft OSPO office
