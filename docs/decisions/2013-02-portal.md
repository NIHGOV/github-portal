# Decision: Portal

The original management solution for the Azure GitHub organization was similar to what a GitHub
employee might call "entitlements": an actual GitHub repository with the source of truth in files,
and the GitHub pull request and other tools used to manage updating that source of truth, plus
automation.

At scale, however, we learned that inviting people manually to the organization to manage the file,
or helping educate users about GitHub usernames and other approaches, was just too challenging and
manual.

A hack prototype of using GitHub OAuth as a primary auth mechanism backed then by corporate AAD was
built to validate a concept of linking accounts, providing automated invitations, and other aspects.

Original intent:

- A management portal for employees to link/join GitHub orgs

Intended lifetime of portal:

- Until GitHub supports more native concepts for automated joining,
- or other extensibility interfaces to configure company-specific endpoints, logic, tools, or URLs on top of GitHub.com native UI
