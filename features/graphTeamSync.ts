  // On the GitHub side, they define:
  // - The team must not have any sub-teams (must be a leaf node)
  // - Can have up to 5 directory groups assigned to the team
  // - Team Maintainers are not touched (TBD need to confirm)
  // - If you suspend sync, it removes all the members

  // Unknowns:
  // - What happens if the sole maint leaves... guess it just becomes an orphan team
  // - How to handle removed directory groups
  // - How much to store, log, show in the UI, or notify people about

  // Value-adds:
  // - When a user links for the first time, kick off a job to evaluate the directory groups they're in
